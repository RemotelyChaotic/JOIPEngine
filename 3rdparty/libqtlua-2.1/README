The QtLua library aims to make Qt4/Qt5 applications scriptable using
the Lua scripting language.


QtLua is released under the GNU LGPL v3 license.

Project documentation can be found online:(Original one)
http://www.nongnu.org/libqtlua/

This fork project provide some features:
- QFlag QtLua::Librarys which provide OR combination when using QtLua::State.openlib()
- Value of QObject (via print()) can be costum by slot "QString toString()"
- Register QObject can limit member access by setting "supreme meta object" which reject member access to it's super one
- Name of QObject can be costum by Q_CLASSINFO("LuaName", NAME_YOU_WANT)
- Can register static member method to registered QObject

Those are not neccessary because of QtLua::MetaType. They added because I didn't notice that class before.
- Methods can use QVariant/QVariantList as parameter or return value in script environment.

Those are once add but removed due to they'll cause crash in some situation:
- Methods can use QObject as parameter or return value without register via QtLua::MetaType
