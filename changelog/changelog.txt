=================
Version 1.2.0.0

  multiple resources.
- Updated Node Editor with copy-paste functionality.
- Undo and Redo functionality implemented for the entire editor.
- Hotload for styles implemented for developping new application styles.
- Resource Viewer has an alternate Explorer View and can display Tree and 
  Explorer View next to each other.

  a JOI-Project and can be used in 'font-family' attributes in the PlayerTextBox.

  This font can be a custom Font type Resource.

  This is not usually recomended, but is a way to give a script more UI control.

  after a timeout or on button press. Styleable like the PlayerTextbox via script.

  flow or jump to specific scenes from a helper script.

  are read-only and can't be downloaded in the editor to protect the
  original creators.
- Added an event system to the UI which allows Project creators to register
  callbacks to events in any eval call.

Changes:
- JOIP-Engine uses PhysFS to allow restricted acces to files only, making it
  impossible to write or read outside of the currently loaded project folder.
- Loading on startup is significantly faster because the logo loads in a
  worker thread.
- Changelog visible in the "About" menu.
- Help has a tree view containing all topics and pages can be searched.
