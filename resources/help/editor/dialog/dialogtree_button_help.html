  <h1>Dialogue Tree</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="container">
    <p>The Dialogue tree is a visualisation and editor for all registered Dialogue lines from the different
    Dialogue <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resources</a> (.joipdlg) in a project.
    It merges all Dialogue lines and Categories into a single tree and lets you edit their properties
    in one view for all Resources.<br>
    The Resource files themselves are serialized into JSON and can also be edited via text editor.</p>

    <br>

    <table>
    <tr><th>Tree UI</th></tr>
    <tr><th><img src="qrc:/resources/help/editor/images/dialog_editor_tree.png"></th></tr>
    </table>

    <br>

    <p>There's three types of Dialogue nodes in a tree:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Category</b>: A Dialogue Category. Serves no functional purpose and serves
        only to "sort" your Dialogue lines. If the same Category is present in multiple Resources, they
        will be merged into one. The Id must currently be globally unique in a Project.<br>
        Too edit the Id, double click the Id cell and enter the new name.</li>

        <li><b>Dialogue</b>: One line of Dialogue or a parent for multiple Conditional Dialogue elements.
        The Id of these must be globally unique and these are the elements that are searched when calling
        <i>getDialogue</i> (<a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">API</a>).
        Dialogues without Conditional Dialogue children define all properties of the Dialogue, while
        Dialogues with Conditional children can have different properties per child except for the tags.<br>
        The following properties are supported:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Id</i>: The identifier of the Dialogue. Is enforced to be globally unique.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Text</i>: The line of Dialogue shown in a TextBox.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Wait</i>: The wait time in ms that determines how long the text is shown.<br>
          -1 means the time is determined automatically based on the Text.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Skippable</i>: Skippable flag. If set, the line of Dialogue is skippable.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Resource</i>: A Sound type <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resource</a>.
          It is played when the Text is shown and stopped if the Text is skipped. If duration of the audio is longer than the Wait time,
          the text is shown for as long as the audio plays.</li>
          <li><i>Tags</i>: Tags attatched to the Dialogue. Dialogues can be searched via tags and they can be used for user defined logic.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Conditional Dialogue</b>: One conditional line of Dialogue.
        The first Conditional Dialogue whose condition evaluates to true will be used when the parent is querried by, for example,
        calling <i>getDialogue</i> (<a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">API</a>).
        The following properties are supported:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Id</i>: The identifier of the Conditional Dialogue. Is enforced to be globally unique.</li>
          <li><i>Text</i>: The line of Dialogue shown in a TextBox.</li>
          <li><i>Wait</i>: The wait time in ms that determines how long the text is shown.<br>
          -1 means the time is determined automatically based on the Text.</li>
          <li><i>Skippable</i>: Skippable flag. If set, the line of Dialogue is skippable.</li>
          <li><i>Resource</i>: A Sound type <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resource</a>.
          It is played when the Text is shown and stopped if the Text is skipped. If duration of the audio is longer than the Wait time,
          the text is shown for as long as the audio plays.</li>
          <li><i>Condition</i>: The condition under which the Dialogue is selected.
          This is <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/eval_api_reference_help.html">UI eval code</a>.
          The first condition that evaluates to true in a Dialogue will be used.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
