  <h1>Dialog Tree</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="container">
    <p>The dialog tree is a visualisation and editor for all registered dialog lines from the different
    dialog <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resources</a> (.joipdlg) in a project.
    It merges all Dialog lines and Categories into a single tree and lets you edit their properties
    in one view for all Resources.<br>
    The Resource files themselves are serialized into JSON and can also be edited via text editor.</p>

    <br>

    <table>
    <tr><th>Tree UI</th></tr>
    <tr><th><img src="qrc:/resources/help/editor/images/dialog_editor_tree.png"></th></tr>
    </table>

    <br>

    <p>There's three types of Dialog nodes in a tree:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Category</b>: A Dialog Category. Serves no functional purpose and serves
        only to "sort" your dialog lines. If the same Category is present in multiple Resources, they
        will be merged into one. The Id must currently be globally unique in a Project.<br>
        Too edit the Id, double click the Id cell and enter the new name.</li>

        <li><b>Dialog</b>: One line of Dialog or a parent for multiple Conditional Dialog elements.
        The Id of these must be globally unique and these are the elements that are searched when calling
        <i>getDialog</i> (<a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">API</a>).
        Dialogs without Conditional Dialog children define all properties of the dialog, while
        Dialogs with Conditional children can have different properties per child except for the tags.<br>
        The following properties are supported:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Id</i>: The identifier of the Dialog. Is enforced to be globally unique.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Text</i>: The line of dialog shown in a TextBox.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Wait</i>: The wait time in ms that determines how long the text is shown.<br>
          -1 means the time is determined automatically based on the Text.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Skippable</i>: Skippable flag. If set, the line of dialog is skippable.</li>
          <li><i>(Only without children) Resource</i>: A Sound type <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resource</a>.
          It is played when the Text is shown and stopped if the Text is skipped. If duration of the audio is longer than the Wait time,
          the text is shown for as long as the audio plays.</li>
          <li><i>Tags</i>: Tags attatched to the dialog. Dialogs can be searched via tags and they can be used for user defined logic.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Conditional Dialog</b>: One conditional line of Dialog.
        The first Conditional Dialog whose condition evaluates to true will be used when the parent is querried by, for example,
        calling <i>getDialog</i> (<a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">API</a>).
        The following properties are supported:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Id</i>: The identifier of the Conditional Dialog. Is enforced to be globally unique.</li>
          <li><i>Text</i>: The line of dialog shown in a TextBox.</li>
          <li><i>Wait</i>: The wait time in ms that determines how long the text is shown.<br>
          -1 means the time is determined automatically based on the Text.</li>
          <li><i>Skippable</i>: Skippable flag. If set, the line of dialog is skippable.</li>
          <li><i>Resource</i>: A Sound type <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resource</a>.
          It is played when the Text is shown and stopped if the Text is skipped. If duration of the audio is longer than the Wait time,
          the text is shown for as long as the audio plays.</li>
          <li><i>Condition</i>: The condition under which the dialog is selected.
          This is <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/eval_api_reference_help.html">UI eval code</a>.
          The first condition that evaluates to true in a Dialog will be used.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
