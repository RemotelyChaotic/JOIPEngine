  <h1>Export Project</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Saves the current <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project</a> in a bundled
    format, which creates a <i>.proj</i> file in the project directory. This file
    is <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/project_name_help.html">named</a> after the project
    and contains all project resources in a single bundled binary file.
    This file can then be distributed instead of the loose files in the project folder.
    Performing this action will <b>not</b> delete the opened project nor change any of it's
    properties, as the exported file is only a copy of the project.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Exporting a project has the important advantage of making the project read only
    (when loaded via the <i>.proj</i> file instead of the loose files), preventing other users
    from easily copying files from the project or making modifications to it.</p>

          will not be loadable by every pc.</td>
