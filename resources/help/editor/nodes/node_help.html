  <h1>Node</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="container">
    <p>A <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project</a> consists
    of nodes of different types, that dictate the flow of a project in the player.<br>
    Nodes have their own settings and a set of connectors on the sides.
    There's five different types of nodes:</p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Entry Point</b>: The start of a <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project</a>
        in the player is allways an "Entry Point" node. There must allways be exactly one "Entry Point" node in a Project, otherwise
        the behavior is undefined and the Project can start at any "Entry Point" node.<br>This is not a scene, and no script
        is associated with an "Entry Point" node.<br></li>

        <li><b>Exit Point</b>: The end of a <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project</a>
        in the player is allways an "Exit Point" node. There's no limit on the number of
        "Exit Point" nodes per Project. One thing to consider is:
        every path in the project should allways eventually lead to an "Exit Point".<br>
        This is not a scene, and no script is associated with an "Exit Point" node.<br></li>

        <li><b>Scene</b>: Scene nodes represent logical units, that contain a set of instructions
        that the player will execute. When you create a "Scene" node,
        you will be prompted to create the associated script <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resource</a> file
        (it helps to have the same name as the "Scene" node,
        but it's not neccessary; just make sure it's in the project folder.)<br>
        There's no limit on the number of "Scene" nodes in a project.<br>
        The line edit shows the internal id of a scene. This is <i>not</i> user visible, must be unique, and
        can be used in <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Scripts</a>
        to jump to the scene ignoring the flow.<br></li>

        <li><b>Path Splitters</b>: These nodes split the flow of a project into up to four
        possible paths. Depending on the type of the "Path Splitter" node the flow in the player will either continue
        with a <i>random</i> node, or prompt the user to <i>select</i> the path.<br>
        "Path Splitter" and "Path Merger" nodes can be combined and chained freely to cerate more path alternatives and
        a mix between <i>random</i> and <i>selectable</i> flow.
        Any empty connectors will be ignored during playing and you do not need to worry about them.<br>
        The four line edits are for the user visible path names if the node is of type <i>selectable</i>.
        They corespond to the user visible button labels in the editor.<br>
        </li>

        <li><b>Path Merger</b>: These nodes merge the flow of a project from up to four
        possible paths.<br>
        "Path Splitter" and "Path Merger" nodes can be combined and chained freely to cerate more path alternatives and
        a mix between <i>random</i> and <i>selectable</i> flow.
        Any empty connectors will be ignored during playing and you do not need to worry about them.<br></li>
      </tr>

    <br>

    <p>Scene nodes are linked together by paths, splitters and mergers.
    The entry point of a <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project</a>
    is allways an "Entry Point" node and the Project ends with an "Exit Point" node.
    "Scenes" are the scripted part of a project and "Path Splitters" and "Path Mergers" link together other nodes.</p>

    <br>

    <p>A more dynamic flow would be to have the splitter linked to two different
    scenes like below.</p>
