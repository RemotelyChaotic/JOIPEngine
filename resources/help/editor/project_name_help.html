  <div class="container">
    <p>This text field lets you edit the <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project's</a>
    name. The project name is the same as the project folder name and thus must conform
    to the operating system's folder naming rules and some application specific rules:</p>

    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>Project names are case-sensitive.</li>
      <li>Project names must be no more than 255 characters in length.</li>
      <li>Project names must not be empty and must contain at least one non-whitespace character.</li>
      <li>The following characters are not allowed: " \ / : | &lt; &gt; * ? &amp; ( ) &#59; + [ ]</li>
      <li>Illegal URL path characters not allowed. Code points like \uE000, are not valid Unicode characters. In addition, some ASCII or Unicode characters, like control characters (0x00 to 0x1F, 0x7f, 0x81, etc.), are also not allowed.</li>
      <li>The following project names are not allowed: LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, PRN, AUX, NUL, CON, CLOCK$, dot character (.), and two dot characters (..).</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>Generally sticking with letters, numbers, - and _ is the safest bet. The project name is not visible
    outside the editor, so it doesn't have to look nice, just be somewhat describtive.</p>

    <br>

    <p>On editing the project name, the folder will <i>not</i> be renamed. It will be renamed, once
    the project is <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/saveproject_button_help.html">saved</a>.</p>
