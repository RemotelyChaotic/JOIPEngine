  <h1>Resource</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Resources are the content files of a <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project</a>
    and must reside in the folder directory. Files outside the project directory cannot be used.
    Resources can represent files of different formats and types and are referenced in the application by their
    internal name / identifier, which does not need to equal the file name.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Resources can be renamed by double-clicking the name field in the
    <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resources_tree_help.html">Resource Tree</a>.
    Renaming a resource changes it's internal identifier, but not the file name.</p>

    <br>

    <p>There's currently four differnt resource types:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Image</b>: Images can be animated or static and are used for the
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/player/card_button_help.html">Title Card</a> and to display
        in the player via <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Media Player</a>
        or as an <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Icon</a>.
        Images can be online or offline. For online resources, the link must point to the image or video url directly.
        Links gated behind logins will not work. These Resources
        will <i>not</i> be downloaded and instead loaded and displayed when needed.<br>
        <i>Supported image formats are</i>: bmp, cur, gif, icns, ico, jpeg, jpg, pbm, pgm, png, ppm,
        svg, svgz, tga, tif, tiff, wbmp, webp, xbm, xpm
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Video</b>: Videos can be displayed in the player via
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Media Player</a>.
        Videos can be online or offline. Online videos only support a subset of the formats.
        For online resources, the link must point to the image or video url directly.
        Links gated behind logins will not work. These Resources
        will <i>not</i> be downloaded and instead loaded and displayed when needed.<br>
        <i>Supported video formats are</i>: 3gp, asf, wmv, mpg, ts, au, avi, flv, mov, mp4 (online available), ogm, ogg, mkv,
        mka, nsc, nsv, nut, a52, dv, vid, ty, webm (online available)
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Audio</b>: Audio files can be played in the player via
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Media Player</a>.<br>
        <i>Supported audio formats are</i>: wav, dts, mp3, mp2, tta, tac, flac, dts, aac, xa
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Other Formats</b>: This resource type is used for various things in the project.
        The flow file is used as storage for the <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/nodes/nodeeditor_help.html">Node Editor's</a>
        content, the js files are used for the <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/nodes/node_help.html">Scene Scripts</a>
        and the <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">Project</a> data is stored
        in json files. One thing they have in common is that all of them can be opened in
        any external text editor to edit the contents.<br>
        <i>Supported other formats are</i>: json, xml (currently unused), js, flow
        <br></li>
      </ul>
