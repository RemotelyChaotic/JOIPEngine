  <h1>Resource</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Resources are the content files of a <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">JOI-Project</a>
    and must reside in the folder directory. Files outside the project directory cannot be used.
    Resources can represent files of different formats and types and are referenced in the application by their
    internal name / identifier, which does not need to equal the file name.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Resources can be renamed by double-clicking the name field in the
    <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resources_tree_help.html">Resource Tree</a>.
    Renaming a resource changes it's internal identifier, but not the file name.</p>

    <br>

    <p>There's currently six differnt Resource types:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Image</b>: Images can be animated or static and are used for the
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/player/card_button_help.html">Title Card</a> and to display
        in the player via <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Media Player</a>
        or as an <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Icon</a>.
        Images can be online or offline. For online Resources, the link must point to the image or video url directly.
        Links gated behind logins will not work. These Resources
        will <i>not</i> be saved on your disk and instead (down-)loaded into memory and displayed when needed.<br>
        <i>Supported image formats are</i>: bmp, cur, gif, icns, ico, jpeg, jpg, pbm, pcx, pgm, png, ppm,
        svg, svgz, tga, tif, tiff, wbmp, webp, xbm, xpm
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Video</b>: Videos can be displayed in the player via
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/code/script_reference_help.html">Media Player</a>.
        Videos can be online or offline. Online videos only support a subset of the formats.
        For online Resources, the link must point to the image or video url directly.
        Links gated behind logins will not work. These Resources
        will <i>not</i> be saved on your disk and instead streamed into memory and displayed when needed.<br>
        <i>Supported video formats are</i>: 3gp, asf, wmv, mpg, ts, au, avi, flv, mov, mp4 (online available), ogm, ogg, mkv,
        mka, nsc, nsv, nut, a52, dv, vid, ty, webm (online available)
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Audio</b>: Audio files can be played in the player via

        <br></li>

        <li><b>Scripts</b>: This Resource type is used for the
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/nodes/node_help.html">Scene Scripts</a>.
        They can be opened in any external text editor to edit the contents.<br>
        <i>Supported script formats are</i>: js
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Fonts</b>: This Resource type is used in the <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/nodes/node_help.html">Scene Scripts</a> to
        set the font-family of a block of text to a custom font. The name of the resource is not used anywhere and is only for flavour and consistency.
        To use the custom fonts you need to reference the font family(ies) specified in the font file.<br>
        <i>Supported font formats are</i>: tff, otf, otc, ttf
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Databases (currently unused)</b>: This Resource type is used for various things in a project.
        One thing all types have in common is that all of them can be opened in
        any external text editor to edit the contents.<br>
        <i>Supported database formats are</i>: json, xml
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Other Formats</b>: This Resource type is used for various things in the project.
        The flow file is used as storage for the <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/nodes/nodeeditor_help.html">Node Editor's</a>
        content, the layout file is used for the Player
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/layout/layout_help.html">Layouts</a> and the
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">Project</a> data is stored
        in the <i>JOIPData.json</i> file. One thing they have in common is that all of them can be opened in
        any external text editor to edit the contents.<br>
        <i>Supported other formats are</i>: json, flow, layout
        <br></li>

        <li><b>(Archives)</b>: This is not an actual resource type but a container
        containing various resources in a bundle. You can include archived resources
        in a project to include the contents of said archive in the project as if you had included the separately.
        Be aware that packing large files in an archive may increase load time when playing the
        <a href="qrc:/resources/help/project/joi_project_help.html">Project</a>.<br>
        <i>Supported archive formats are</i>: zip, 7z, grp, pak, hog, mvl, wad, slb, iso, vdf<br>
        Note: These are the only currently supported archives due to the application requiring
        fast random access. This list may be extended in future for non-random-access formats.
        <br></li>
