  <h1>JOI-Project</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="container">
    <p>JOI-Projects are a collection of <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resource</a> files,
    a <i>JOIPData.json</i>, a <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/nodes/node_help.html">SceneModel.flow</a> file
    and optionally a <a href="qrc:/resources/help/layout/layout_help.html">Layout</a> file (if a project contains no Layout file,
    a default Layout file will be used). With the help of script <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resources</a>
    the application can display media <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/resources/resource_help.html">Resources</a> according to user defined
    logic.<br>
    A JOI-Project can be played from <a href="qrc:/resources/help/play_button_help.html">Play</a>
    and edited from <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor_button_help.html">Editor</a> in the main menu.</p>

    <br>

    <p>JOI-Projects also have a set of properties that can be edited in the <b>Project Properties</b>
    view of the editor. They are:<br>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Project Name</b>: The <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/project_name_help.html">Project Name</a>
        is the same as the project folder name and thus must conform
        to the operating system's folder naming rules and some application specific rules.
        The project name is not visible outside the editor, so it doesn't have to look nice,
        just be somewhat describtive.<br></li>

        <li><b>Project Version</b>: This <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/projectsettings/projectversion_help.html">Version</a> is not used for anything internally, but is visible to users in the
        project selection. It can be used, to keep track of different versions of a released
        JOI-Project.<br></li>

        <li><b>Target Engine Version</b>: The <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/projectsettings/engineversion_help.html">JOIP-Engine Version</a> this JOI-Project
        was last saved in. If the engine version doesn't match the curent version, a warning will be shown in the editor.
        Opening JOI-Projects with a newer engine version in the player or editor might mean, some features are not working correctly, while
        opening JOI-Projects with an older engine version is not an issue.<br></li>

        <li><b>Describtion</b>: The <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/projectsettings/describtion_textedit_help.html">Describtion</a> can contain html tags for formating and is visible to users in the
        project selection.<br></li>

        <li><b>Fetishes / Kinks</b>: The set of <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/projectsettings/fetish_tree_help.html">Kinks / Fetishes</a>, this JOI-Project
        was tagged with.<br></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>JOI-Projects aditionally have a set of hidden properties that are not visible, but influence
    interactions with the project:<br>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Bundled</b>: A bundled project is a project, that was <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor/exportproject_button_help.html">Exported</a>
        and can only be played or viewed but not edited in the <a href="qrc:/resources/help/editor_button_help.html">Editor</a>.<br></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
